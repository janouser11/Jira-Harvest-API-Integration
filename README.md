# Intern-Project-Harvest
CRON job to create JIRA ticket work-logs from Harvest entries

Java Wrappers used:

https://github.com/johnkangcurd/harvestclient

https://github.com/eskobaba/jira-rest-client

Quick Start!!

1. Edit username/password for Jira in src/main/resources/jira-rest-client.properties.
2. Edit username/password for Harvest in App.class code.


Don't forget that both accounts need to have admin rights!

https://jitpack.io/ was used to create a repository and dependency for the forked github Harvest project.
